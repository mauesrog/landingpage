# Maui's Club Landpage

Using slack.com as inspiration, I tried to emulate as much of the style as I could purely with flexbox. I was able to replicate the style of the header (with my own SVG logo), of my main title, and of the form, all with custom data. I also used a very similar linear gradient ending in black and emulated the bottom bar. Also when resizing the window up to a certain width, I was able to copy the strategy slack.com uses to accomplish a neat rearrangement of elements. For the extra credit part, I succeeded to create the first two ideas i.e. a fancy CSS transition and the CSS Checkbox hack part for that menu.
